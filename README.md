# Multi-Step Form

A multi-step form with a progress bar is a user interface pattern commonly used to break down a complex form into smaller, more manageable steps. This allows users to focus on one section at a time, reducing cognitive overload and improving the overall user experience.

This implementation utilizes React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create a dynamic and interactive multi-step form with a progress bar. The form is divided into multiple steps, and users can navigate between steps using next and previous buttons. A progress bar visually represents the completion status of each step, giving users a clear indication of their progress.
